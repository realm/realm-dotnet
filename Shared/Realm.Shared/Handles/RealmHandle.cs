// Replaces IntPtr as a handle to a c++ realm class
// Using criticalHandle makes the binding more robust with regards to out-of-band exceptions and finalization
// We also have better guarantee that our finalizer is in fact called, especially in case of an unorderly app shutdown
// We do not use SafeHandle because our users do not call the same realm handles in a concurrent way, except if the call
// comes in via the finalizer thread
// Extra care must be taken to make sure we don't have problems with finalizer concurrency in the case that core gets finalizer concurrent
// -read up on notes reg. CriticalHandle, and SafeHandle and potential problems with concurrency that are mitigated by the C# library by
// refcounting the SafeHandle on interop calls
// I think we can save the performance penalty induced by SafeHandle because we know for sure that we will in fact never (for the same handle) call other than constructors
// concurrenlty - because when we are in a finalizer, the user thread for this handle is definetly dead. (except if several wrappers have been
// taken out for this particular handle - in that case we do in fact risk having several finalizing objects, and several live ones -and seen from the
// user perspective, the live ones are acessed in a serialized way)
// however, in that case (say same table taken out of a shared group 10 times) the last 9 tables are refcounted in core, so them being refcounted down
// should not affect the tenth table being accessed concurrenlty at the same time

// according to .net sourcecode we have a guarentee that a CriticalHandle will not get finalized while it is used in an interop call

/*
 * 3) GC.KeepAlive behavior - P/Invoke vs. finalizer thread ---- (HandleRef)
 * 4) Enforcement of the above via the type system - Don't use IntPtr anymore.
