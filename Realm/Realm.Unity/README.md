![Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet/raw/main/logo.png)

Realm is an embedded mobile database that runs directly on phones, tablets, or desktops.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets, and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/dotnet/objects/) and [queryable by code](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/dotnet/query-engine/), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to just a few common classes](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/dotnet/latest/): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and modern C# idioms.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
