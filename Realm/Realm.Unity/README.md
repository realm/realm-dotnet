Realm is an embedded mobile database that runs directly on phones, tablets, or desktops.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets, and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/dotnet/model-data/object-models-and-schemas/#std-label-dotnet-objects/) and [queryable by code](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/dotnet/crud/filter/), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to just a few common classes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/dotnet/latest/): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and modern C# idioms.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
* **[Device Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/)**: Makes it simple to keep data in sync across users, devices, and your backend in real-time. Get started for free with [a template application](https://github.com/mongodb/template-app-maui-todo) and [create the cloud backend](http://mongodb.com/realm/register?utm_medium=github_atlas_CTA&utm_source=realm_dotnet_github).
