# About SmokeTestWin32Console

This is a very simple program showing a Realm instance being loaded, data written and queried, in a pure Console app.

It builds for x86 and x64.

Note that it only uses the standalone Realm.Database nuget.

The project was created and tested under Visual Studio 2017 RC.
