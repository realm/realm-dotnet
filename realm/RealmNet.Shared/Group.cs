         * By default, the operator == tests for reference equality by determining if two references indicate the same object,
         * so reference types do not need to implement operator == in order to gain this functionality. When a type is immutable,
         * meaning the data contained in the instance cannot be changed, overloading operator == to compare value equality
         * instead of reference equality can be useful because, as immutable objects, they can be considered the same as
         * long as they have the same value. Overriding operator == in non-immutable types is not recommended.
         * 
         * Above is the rationale behind Group not having an overwritten == operator

        /*MSDN
         * Guidelines for Reference Types The following guidelines apply to overriding Equals(Object) for a reference type:
         * 
         * Consider overriding Equals if the semantics of the type are based on the fact that the type represents some value(s). 
         * Most reference types must not overload the equality operator, even if they override Equals. However,
         * if you are implementing a reference type that is intended to have value semantics, such as a complex number type,
         * you must override the equality operator.
         * You should not override Equals on a mutable reference type. 
         * This is because overriding Equals requires that you also override the GetHashCode method,
         * as discussed in the previous section. This means that the hash code of an instance of a mutable reference type 
         * can change during its lifetime, which can cause the object to be lost in a hash table.
