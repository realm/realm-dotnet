![Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet/raw/master/logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.

This repository holds the source code for the .NET / C# versions of Realm. Currently, we only support Xamarin, specifically Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android. We do plan to support Xamarin.Mac, UWP, and Unity in the future.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/xamarin/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/xamarin/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to just 2 common classes](https://realm.io/docs/xamarin/latest/api/) (RealmObject and Realm): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and modern C# idioms.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Getting Started

## Building Realm

We highly recommend [using our pre-built binaries via NuGet](https://realm.io/docs/xamarin/latest/#installation) but you can also build from source.

Prerequisites:

* **If you target Android/iOS via Xamarin:** Xamarin Community or above. 
* **Windows platforms:** Visual Studio 2015.
* Building Xamarin iOS apps also requires Xcode 7.1.
* Building Realm documentation requires [Doxygen](http:/www.doxygen.org) and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org)
* If you are using Xamarin Studio, the [StyleCop Support](http://addins.monodevelop.com/Project/Index/54) add-in is required.

We support the current Xamarin _Stable_ update channel, at the time of release this corresponded to:

* Xamarin iOS version 10.0.1.10
* Xamarin Android version 7.0.1.3
* Xamarin Studio version 6.1.1

**Note for Debugging** that the following steps mention building for **Release.** If you are debugging, just substitute **Debug** and you probably also want to choose **Debug | iPhoneSimulator** as a platform.

1. Open a terminal window in the `wrappers` directory
1. `make clean`
1. `make all` - this will probably download a current version of core binaries, unless you have built recently. The download and subsequent builds will take some time, depending on your system, as it builds a binary wrapper library for each platform including all Android CPU variations.
1. Open the `Realm.sln` in `Xamarin Studio` on OS X 
    1. Choose the Solution `Realm` in the Solution navigator and context menu to `Clean Realm`
    1. platform popup **Release | Default**
    1. select `Realm.PCL` project and Build
    1. select `RealmWeaver.Fody` project and Build
    1. select platform popup **Release | ARM**
    1. select `Realm.XamarinAndroid` project and Build
    1. ensure you have an iOS device attached
    1. select platform popup **Release | iPhone**
    1. select `Realm.XamarinIOS` project and Build
1. If you want to build the NuGet packages, go on from this point and follow the steps in  `internals/RealmDotnetNugetBuild.md`

If you are actively testing code against the Realm source, see also the unit test projects and other tests under the Tests folder.
