![Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet/raw/main/logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly on phones, tablets or wearables.

This repository holds the source code for the .NET / C# versions of Realm. Currently, we support all major mobile and desktop operating systems, such as iOS, Android, UWP, macOS, Linux, and Windows. For a full list of supported platforms and their versions, check out the [Supported Platforms](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/dotnet/#supported-platforms) sub-section in the documentation.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets, and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/dotnet/objects/) and [queryable by code](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/dotnet/query-engine/), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to just a few common classes](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/dotnet/latest/): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and modern C# idioms.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
* **[Device Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/app-services/device-sync)**: Makes it simple to keep data in sync across users, devices, and your backend in real-time. Get started for free with [a template application](https://github.com/mongodb/template-app-maui-todo) and [create the cloud backend](http://mongodb.com/realm/register?utm_medium=github_atlas_CTA&utm_source=realm_dotnet_github).

## Nightly builds

If you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use the preview releases published after every
commit to our private NuGet feed. The source URL you need to specify for our feed is `https://s3.amazonaws.com/realm.nugetpackages/index.json`.
Refer to [this guide](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/nuget/consume) for instructions on adding custom sources to the NuGet Package Manager.

## Building Realm

We highly recommend [using our pre-built binaries via NuGet](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/dotnet/install/#open-the-nuget-package-manager) but you can also build from source.

Prerequisites:

* Visual Studio 2019 Community or above.
* Building iOS/macOS apps also requires Xcode 8.1 or above.

Instructions:

1. Download and build the native libraries using the instructions in [`wrappers/README.md`](wrappers/README.md)
1. Open the `Realm.sln` in `Visual Studio`
1. Build `Realm`, `Realm.Fody` and `Realm.SourceGenerator`
1. Build and run the tests for the relevant platforms.

If you are actively testing code against the Realm source, see also the unit test projects and other tests under the Tests folder.

## Examples

Some minimal examples of Realm use can be found in the `examples` folder:

* [QuickJournal](examples/QuickJournal): a quick journaling [MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui) application that shows how Realm can be used effectively in conjunction with MVVM and data binding.
* [SimpleToDo](examples/SimpleToDoAvalonia): a simple to-do list [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) application that shows how Realm can be used effectively in conjunction with MVVM and data binding.
