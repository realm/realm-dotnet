x.y.z (TBD)
------------------

### Breaking Changes

### Enhancements
- Added Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) credentials provider. (#1254)

### Bug fixes


1.0.4 (2017-02-21)
------------------

### Bug fixes

- The `Realm` NuGet package no longer clobbers the path to Win32 native binaries in `Realm.Database`. (#1239)
- Fixed a bug where garbage collecting an object with `PropertyChanged` subscribers would cause crashes. (#1237)

1.0.3 (2017-02-14)
------------------
# Out of Beta!
After about a year and a half of hard work, we are proud to call this a 1.0 release. There is still work to do, but Realm Xamarin is now being used by thousands of developers and has proven reliable.

## Sync
Realm Xamarin now works with the Realm Mobile Platform. This means that you can write Xamarin apps that synchronize seamlessly with a Realm Object Server, allowing you to write complex apps with Xamarin that are offline-first and automatically synchronised by adding just a few lines of code.
You can read about this in the [documentation](https://realm.io/docs/xamarin/latest/#sync).

## Windows Desktop
Realm Xamarin is no longer iOS and Android only. You can now use it to write .NET programs for Windows Desktop. Add the NuGet package to your regular .NET project and start using Realm. Some features are not supported on Windows yet. Most notably, sync does not yet work for Windows, but also encryption and notifications across processes are missing. We are working on it and you can expect support soon.

### Breaking Changes
 - `IRealmCollection<T>.ObjectSchema` is deprecated and replaced with `ISchemaSource.ObjectSchema`. (#1216) 

### Bug fixes
 - `[MapTo]` attribute is now respected in queries. (#1219)
 - Letting a Realm instance be garbage collected instead of disposing it will no longer lead to crashes. (#1212)
 - Unsubscribing from `RealmObject.PropertyChanged` in a `PropertyChanged` callback should no longer lead to crashes. (#1207)
 - `WriteAsync` now advances the read transaction so the changes made asynchronously are available immediately in the original thread. (#1192)
 - Queries on backlink properties should no longer produce unexpected results. (#1177)


0.82.1 (2017-01-27)
-------------------
### Bug fixes
- Addressed an issue where obtaining a Realm instance, reading an object, then obtaining another instance on the same thread would cause the object to become invalid and crash the application upon accessing any of its members.

0.82.0 (2017-01-23)
-------------------
### Breaking Changes
- Moved all exceptions under the `Realms.Exceptions` namespace. (#1075)
- Moved `RealmSchema` to `Realms.Schema` namespace. (#1075)
- Made the `ErrorEventArgs` constructor internal. (#1075)
- Made `ObjectSchema.Builder` and `RealmSchema.Builder` internal. (#1075)
- Passing an object that has `IList` properties to `Add(obj, update: true)` will no longer merge the lists. Instead, the `IList` property will contain only the items in the object. (#1040)

### Enhancements
- Added virtual `OnPropertyChanged` method in `RealmObject` that you can override to be notified of changes to the current object. (#1047)
- Added compile time checks that `[Required]` is applied on correct property types. (#1072)
- `Realm.Add(RealmObject obj)` will now return the passed in object, similarly to `Realm.Add<T>(T obj)`. (#1162)
- Added an extension method for `string.Contains` that accepts `StringComparison` argument and can be used in queries. When querying, only `StringComparison.Ordinal` and `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` can be used. When not used in queries, all values for `StringComparison` are valid. (#1141)

### Bug fixes
- Adding a standalone object, that has an `IList<T>` property that has never been accessed, to the Realm will no longer throw a `NullReferenceException`. (#1040)
- `IList<T>` properties will now correctly return `IsReadOnly = true` when managed by a readonly Realm. (#1070)
- The weaver should now correctly resolve references in PCL and netstandard assemblies. (#1117)
- Add some missing methods to the PCL reference assembly. (#1093)
- Disposed realms will not throw `ObjectDisposedException` when trying to access their members. Additionally, disposing a realm will not invalidate other instances on the same thread. (#1063)

0.81.0 (2016-12-14)
-------------------
### Breaking Changes
* The `IQueryable<T>.ToNotifyCollectionChanged` extension methods that accept parameters are now deprecated. There is a new parameterless one that you should use instead. If you want to handle errors, you can do so by subscribing to the `Realm.OnError` event. (#938)
* `RealmResults<T>` is now marked `internal` and `Realm.All<T>()` will instead return `IQueryable<T>`. We've added a new extension method `IQueryable<T>.SubscribeForNotifications(NotificationCallbackDelegate<T>)` that allows subscribing for notifications. (#942)
* `Realm.CreateObject<T>` has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. (It could cause a dangerous data loss when using the synchronised realms coming soon, if a class has a PrimaryKey). (#998)
* `RealmConfiguration.ReadOnly` has been renamed to `RealmConfiguration.IsReadOnly` and is now a property instead of a field. (#858)
* `Realm.All` has been renamed to `Realm.GetAll` and the former has been obsoleted. (#858)
* `Realm.ObjectForPrimaryKey` has been renamed to `Realm.Find` and the former has been obsoleted. (#858)
* `Realm.Manage` has been renamed to `Realm.Add` and the former has been obsoleted. (#858)
* `RealmConfiguration.PathToRealm` has been renamed to `Realm.GetPathToRealm` and the former has been obsoleted. (#858)
* `RealmResults.NotificationCallback` has been extracted as a non-nested class and has been renamed to `NotificationCallbackDelegate`. (#858)
* `Realm.Close` has been removed in favor of `Realm.Dispose`. (#858)
* `RealmList<T>` is now marked `internal`. You should use `IList<T>` to define collection relationships. (#858)

### Enhancements
* In data-binding scenarios, if a setter is invoked by the binding outside of write transaction, we'll create an implicit one and commit it. This enables two-way data bindings without keeping around long-lived transactions. (#901)
* The Realm schema can now express non-nullable reference type properties with the new `[Required]` attribute. (#349)
* Exposed a new `Realm.Error` event that you can subscribe for to get notified for exceptions that occur outside user code. (#938)
* The runtime types of the collection, returned from `Realm.All` and the collection created for `IList<T>` properties on `RealmObject` now implement `INotifyCollectionChanged` so you can pass them for data-binding without any additional casting. (#938, #909)
* All RealmObjects implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`. This allows you to pass them directly for data-binding.
* Added `Realm.Compact` method that allows you to reclaim the space used by the Realm. (#968)
* `Realm.Add` returns the added object. (#931)
* Support for backlinks aka `LinkingObjects`. (#219)
* Added an `IList<T>.Move` extension method that allows you to reorder elements within the collection. For managed Lists, it calls a native method, so it is slightly more efficient than removing and inserting an item, but more importantly, it will raise the `CollectionChanged` with `NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Move` which will result in a nice move animation, rather than a reload of a ListView. (#995)

### Bug fixes
* Subscribing to `PropertyChanged` on a RealmObject and modifying an instance of the same object on a different thread will now properly raise the event. (#909)
* Using `Insert` to insert items at the end of an `IList` property will no longer throw an exception. (#978)

0.80.0 (2016-10-27)
-------------------
### Breaking Changes
* This version updates the file format. Older versions will not be able to open files created with this version. (#846)
* `RealmList<T>` is now marked as internal. If you were using it anywhere, you should migrate to `IList<T>`. (#880)

### Enhancements
* iOS Linking all should work - we now add a [Preserve] attribue to all woven members of your `RealmObject` subclasses so you do not need to manually add `[Preserve(allMembers=true)]`  (#822)
* `Realm.Manage` calls are now much faster. You should prefer that to `Realm.CreateObject` unless you are setting only a few properties, while leaving the rest with default values. (#857)
* Added `bool update` argument to `Realm.Manage`. When `update: true` is passed, Realm will try to find and update a persisted object with the same PrimaryKey. If an object with the same PrimaryKey is not found, the umnamaged object is added. If the passed in object does not have a PrimaryKey, it will be added. Any related objects will be added or updated depending on whether they have PrimaryKeys. (#871)
    
    **NOTE**: cyclic relationships, where object references are not identical, will not be reconciled. E.g. this will work as expected:
    ```csharp
    var person = new Person { Name = "Peter", Id = 1 };
    person.Dog = new Dog();
    person.Dog.Owner = person;
    ```
    However this will not - it will set the Person's properties to the ones from the last instance it sees:
    ```csharp
    var person = new Person { Name = "Peter", Id = 1 };
    person.Dog = new Dog();
    person.Dog.Owner = new Person { Id = 1 };
    ```
    This is important when deserializing data from json, where you may have multiple instances of object with the same Id, but with different properties.

* `Realm.Manage` will no longer throw an exception if a managed object is passed. Instead, it will immediately return. (#871)
* Added non-generic version of `Realm.Manage`. (#871)
* Added support for nullable integer PrimaryKeys. Now you can have `long?` PrimaryKey property where `null` is a valid unique value. (#877)
* Added a weaver warning when applying Realm attributes (e.g. `[Indexed]` or `[PrimaryKey]`) on non-persisted properties. (#882)
* Added support for `==` and `!=` comparisons to realm objects in LINQ (#896), e.g.:
    ```csharp
    var peter = realm.All<Person>().FirstOrDefault(d => d.Name == "Peter");
    var petersDogs = realm.All<Dog>().Where(d => d.Owner == peter);
    ```
* Added support for `StartsWith(string, StringComparison)`, `EndsWith(string, StringComparison)`, and `Equals(string, StringComparison)` filtering in LINQ. (#893)

    **NOTE**: Currently only `Ordinal` and `OrdinalIgnoreCase` comparisons are supported. Trying to pass in a different one will result in runtime error. If no argument is supplied, `Ordinal` will be used.

0.78.1 (2016-09-15)
-------------------
### Bug fixes
* `Realm.ObjectForPrimaryKey()` now returns null if it failed to find an object (#833).
* Querying anything but persisted properties now throws instead of causing a crash (#251 and #723)

Uses core 1.5.1


0.78.0 (2016-09-09)
-------------------
### Breaking Changes
* The term `ObjectId` has been replaced with `PrimaryKey` in order to align with the other SDKs. This affects the `[ObjectId]` attribute used to decorate a property.

### Enhancements
* You can retrieve single objects quickly using `Realm.ObjectForPrimaryKey()` if they have a `[PrimaryKey]` property specified. (#402)
* Manual migrations are now supported. You can specify exactly how your data should be migrated when updating your data model. (#545)
* LINQ searches no longer throw a `NotSupportedException` if your integer type on the other side of an expression fails to exactly match your property's integer type.
* Additional LINQ methods now supported: (#802)
    * Last
    * LastOrDefault
    * FirstOrDefault
    * SingleOrDefault
    * ElementAt
    * ElementAtOrDefault

### Bug fixes
* Searching char field types now works. (#708)
* Now throws a RealmMigrationSchemaNeededException if you have changed a `RealmObject` subclass declaration and not incremented the `SchemaVersion` (#518)
* Fixed a bug where disposing a `Transaction` would throw an `ObjectDisposedException` if its `Realm` was garbage-collected (#779)
* Corrected the exception being thrown `IndexOutOfRangeException` to be  `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`

Uses core 1.5.1


0.77.2 (2016-08-11)
-------------------
### Enhancements
* Setting your **Build Verbosity** to `Detailed` or `Normal` will now display a message for every property woven, which can be useful if you suspect errors with Fody weaving.
* Better exception messages will helo diagnose _EmptySchema_ problems (#739)
* Partial evaluation of LINQ expressions means more expressions types are supported as operands in binary expressions (#755)
* Support for LINQ queries that check for `null` against `string`, `byte[]` and `Nullable<T>` properties.
* Support for `string.IsNullOrEmpty` on persisted properties in LINQ queries.
* Schema construction has been streamlined to reduce overhead when opening a Realm
* Schema version numbers now start at 0 rather than UInt64.MaxValue

### Bug fixes
* `RealmResults<T>` should implement `IQueryable.Provider` implicitly (#752)
* Realms that close implicitly will no longer invalidate other instances (#746)

Uses core 1.4.2


0.77.1 (2016-07-25)
-------------------
### Minor Changes
* Fixed a bug weaving pure PCL projects, released in v0.77.0 (#715)
* Exception messages caused by using incompatible arguments in LINQ now include the offending argument (#719)
* PCL projects using ToNotifyCollectionChanged may have crashed due to mismatch between PCL signatures and platform builds.

Uses core 1.4.0


0.77.0 (2016-07-18)
-------------------
**Broken Version** - will not build PCL projects

### Breaking Changes
* Sort order change in previous version was reverted.

### Major Changes
* It is now possible to introspect the schema of a Realm. (#645)
* The Realm class received overloads for `Realm.CreateObject` and `Realm.All` that accept string arguments instead of generic parameters, enabling use of the `dynamic` keyword with objects whose exact type is not known at compile time. (#646)
* _To Many_ relationships can now be declared with an `IList<DestClass>` rather than requiring `RealmList<DestClass>`. This is **significantly faster** than using `RealmList` due to caching the list.   (Issue #287)
* Creating standalone objects with lists of related objects is now possible. Passing such an object into `Realm.Manage` will cause the entire object graph from that object down to become managed.

### Minor Changes
* Fixed a crash on iOS when creating many short-lived realms very rapidly in parallel (Issue #653)
* `RealmObject.IsValid` can be called to check if a managed object has been deleted
* Accessing properties on invalid objects will throw an exception rather than crash with a segfault (#662)
* Exceptions thrown when creating a Realm no longer leave a leaking handle (Issue #503)

Uses core 1.4.0


0.76.1 (2016-06-15)
-------------------

### Minor Changes
* The `Realm` static constructor will no longer throw a `TypeLoadException` when there is an active `System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilder` in the current `AppDomain`.
* Fixed `Attempting to JIT compile` exception when using the Notifications API on iOS devices. (Issue #620)

### Breaking Changes
No API change but sort order changes slightly with accented characters grouped together and some special characters sorting differently. "One third" now sorts ahead of "one-third".

It uses the table at ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt

It groups all characters that look visually identical, that is, it puts a, à, å together and before ø, o, ö even. This is a flaw because, for example, å should come last in Denmark. But it's the best we can do now, until we get more locale aware.

Uses core 1.1.2

0.76.0 (2016-06-09)
-------------------

### Major Changes
* `RealmObject` classes will now implicitly implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` if you specify the interface on your class. Thanks to [Joe Brock](https://github.com/jdbrock) for this contribution!

### Minor Changes
* `long` is supported in queries (Issue #607)
* Linker error looking for `System.String System.String::Format(System.IFormatProvider,System.String,System.Object)` fixed (Issue #591)
* Second-level descendants of `RealmObject` and static properties in `RealmObject` classes now cause the weaver to properly report errors as we don't (yet) support those. (Issue #603)
* Calling `.Equals()` on standalone objects no longer throws. (Issue #587)


0.75.0 (2016-06-02)
-------------------

### Breaking Changes
* File format of Realm files is changed. Files will be automatically upgraded but opening a Realm file with older versions of Realm is not possible. NOTE: If you were using the Realm Browser specified for the old format you need to upgrade. Pick up the newest version [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/realm-browser/id1007457278).
* `RealmResults<T>` no longer implicitly implements `INotifyCollectionChanged`. Use the new `ToNotifyCollectionChanged` method instead.

### Major Changes
* `RealmResults<T>` can be observed for granular changes via the new `SubscribeForNotifications` method.
* `Realm` gained the `WriteAsync` method which allows a write transaction to be executed on a background thread.
* Realm models can now use `byte[]` properties to store binary data.
* `RealmResults<T>` received a new `ToNotifyCollectionChanged` extension method which produces an `ObservableCollection<T>`-like wrapper suitable for MVVM data binding.

### Minor Fixes
* Nullable `DateTimeOffset` properties are supported now.
* Setting `null` to a string property will now correctly return `null`
* Failure to install Fody will now cause an exception like "Realms.RealmException: Fody not properly installed. RDB2_with_full_Realm.Dog is a RealmObject but has not been woven." instead of a `NullReferenceException`
* The PCL `RealmConfiguration` was missing some members.
* The Fody weaver is now discoverable at non-default nuget repository paths.


0.74.1 Released (2016-05-10)
-------------------
### Minor Fixes
* Realms now refresh properly on Android when modified in other threads/processes.
* Fixes crashes under heavy combinations of threaded reads and writes.

### Minor Changes
* The two `Realm` and `RealmWeaver` NuGet packages have been combined into a single `Realm` package.
* The `String.Contains(String)`, `String.StartsWith(String)`, and `String.EndsWith(String)` methods now support variable expressions. Previously they only worked with literal strings.  
* `RealmResults<T>` now implements `INotifyCollectionChanged` by raising the `CollectionChanged` event with `NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Reset` when its underlying table or query result is changed by a write transaction.

0.74.0 Private Beta (2016-04-02)
-------------------

### Major Changes
* The Realm assembly weaver now submits anonymous usage data during each build, so we can track statistics for unique builders, as done with the Java, Swift and Objective-C products (issue #182)
* `Realm.RemoveRange<>()` and `Realm.RemoveAll<>()` methods added to allow you to delete objects from a realm.
* `Realm.Write()` method added for executing code within an implicitly committed transaction
* You can now restrict the classes allowed in a given Realm using `RealmConfiguration.ObjectClasses`.
* LINQ improvements:
  * Simple bool searches work without having to use `== true` (issue #362)
  * ! operator works to negate either simple bool properties or complex expressions (issue #77)
  * Count, Single and First can now be used after a Where expression,  (#369) eg <br /> 
    `realm.All<Owner>().Where(p => p.Name == "Dani").First();` as well as with a lambda expression <br />
    `realm.All<Owner>().Single( p => p.Name == "Tim");` 
  * Sorting is now provided using the `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, `ThenBy` and `ThenByDescending` clauses. Sorts can be applied to results of a query from a `Where` clause or sorting the entire class by applying after `All<>`.
  * The `String.Contains(String)`, `String.StartsWith(String)`, and `String.EndsWith(String)` methods can now be used in Where clauses.  
  * DateTimeOffset properties can be compared in queries.
* Support for `armeabi` builds on old ARM V5 and V6 devices has been removed.  

### Minor Changes
* Finish `RealmList.CopyTo` so you can apply `ToList` to related lists (issue #299)
* NuGet now inserts `libwrappers.so` for Android targets using `$(SolutionDir)packages` so it copes with the different relative paths in cross-platform (Xamarin Forms) app templates vs pure Android templates.  
* `Realm.RealmChanged` event notifies you of changes made to the realm
* `Realm.Refresh()` makes sure the realm is updated with changes from other threads.


0.73.0 Private Beta (2016-02-26)
-------------------
### Major Changes
* `RealmConfiguration.EncryptionKey` added so files can be encrypted and existing encrypted files from other Realm sources opened (assuming you have the key)


### Minor Fixes
* For PCL users, if you use `RealmConfiguration.DefaultConfiguration` without having linked a platform-specific dll, you will now get the warning message with a `PlatformNotSupportedException`. Previously threw a `TypeInitExepction`.
* Update to Core v0.96.2 and matching ObjectStore (issue #393)


0.72.1 Private Beta (2016-02-15) 
-------------------
No functional changes. Just added library builds for Android 64bit targets `x86_64` and `arm64-v8a`.


0.72.0 Private Beta (2016-02-13)
-------------------

Uses Realm core 0.96.0

### Major Changes

* Added support for PCL so you can now use the NuGet in your PCL GUI or viewmodel libraries.

0.71.1 Private Beta (2016-01-29)
-------------------
### Minor Fixes

Building IOS apps targeting the simulator sometimes got an error like:

    Error MT5209: Native linking error...building for iOS simulator, 
    but linking in object file built for OSX, for architecture i386 (MT5209) 

This was fixed by removing a redundant simulator library included in NuGet


0.71.0 Private Beta (2016-01-25)
-------------------

Uses Realm core 0.95.6.

### Platform Changes
Now supporting:

* Xamarin Studio on Mac - IOS and Android
* Xamarin Studio on Windows -  Android
* Visual Studio on Windows -  IOS and Android


### Major Changes

* Added Android support as listed above.
* Added `RealmConfiguration` to provide reusable way to specify path and other settings.
* Added `Realm.Equals`, `Realm.GetHashCode` and `Realm.IsSameInstance` to provide equality checking so you can confirm realms opened in the same thread are equal (shared internal instance).
* Added `Realm.DeleteFiles(RealmConfiguration)` to aid in cleaning up related files.
* Added nullable basic types such as `int?`.
* Optimised `Realm.All<userclass>().Count()` to get rapid count of all objects of given class.
* Related lists are now supported in standalone objects.

#### LINQ 
* `Count()` on `Where()` implemented.
* `Any()` on `Where()` implemented.
* `First( lambda )` and `Single( lambda )` implemented.
* Significant optimisation of `Where()` to be properly lazy, was instantiating all objects internally.


### API-Breaking Changes

* `[PrimaryKey]` attribute renamed `[ObjectId]`.
* `Realm.Attach(object)` renamed `Manage(object)`.
* Lists of related objects are now declared with `IList<otherClass>` instead of `RealmList`.

### Bug fixes

* Bug that caused a linker error for iPhone simulator fixed (#375)


0.70.0 First Private Beta (2015-12-08)
--------------------------
Requires installation from private copy of NuGet download.

### State

* Supported IOS with Xamarin Studio only.
* Basic model and read/write operations with simple LINQ `Where` searches.
* NuGet hosted as downloads from private realm/realm-dotnet repo.
